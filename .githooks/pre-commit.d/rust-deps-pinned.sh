# Reproducible-release gate for Cargo projects: refuse a commit that would make
# a versioned tag non-reproducible. Only runs when Cargo.toml is present (skips
# silently otherwise), so non-Rust repos are unaffected. BLOCKS on a real
# problem; fail-OPEN whenever the environment can't give a reliable answer (no
# cargo, empty offline cache, a path-dep sibling not checked out) — CI's
# `cargo … --locked` is the authoritative backstop.
#
# It catches the ways a "pinned" release silently isn't:
#   1. A workflow that FLOATING-clones a sibling repo (same GitHub owner) with
#      no `--branch`/`-b` — the published build then resolves against whatever
#      that repo's HEAD happens to be, not a fixed tag.
#   2. A workflow `actions/checkout` of a sibling repo with no `ref:` — same
#      floating hazard, via the action instead of raw git.
#   3. A committed Cargo.lock whose own package version drifted from Cargo.toml
#      (bumped the manifest, forgot to re-lock — only blows up at `cargo publish`).
#   4. A Cargo.lock that `cargo metadata --locked` reports as stale.
#
# Bypass once (NOT recommended): git commit --no-verify
